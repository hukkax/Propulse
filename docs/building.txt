Propulse Tracker build instructions
===================================

Requirements:

- FreePascal 3.0+: http://www.freepascal.org/
- Lazarus: http://www.lazarus-ide.org/ (CodeTyphon works too)

The following required headers are contained in the src/include directory:

- SDL2: http://libsdl.org/ - the Pascal headers I use in Propulse for loading
  SDL2 dynamically: https://sourceforge.net/projects/lazsdl2/
- BASS: http://www.un4seen.com/
- Generics.Collections for FreePascal (may already be integrated to current
  FPC trunk):  https://github.com/dathox/generics.collections
- libSOXR (optional for resampling functionality):
  https://sourceforge.net/p/soxr/wiki/Home/

Building on Windows:

- Install FreePascal 3.x and Lazarus
- Open Propulse.lps in Lazarus or Propulse.ctpr in CodeTyphon
- Press Shift-F9 to build
- Probably complain to me if it didn't work

Building on Linux:

- Install SDL2 development packages
- Download the "stuff" Linux build of BASS (the official 2.4.12 Linux build
  has a crash bug on some systems, including mine):
  http://www.un4seen.com/stuff/bass-linux.zip
- Extract the appropriate libbass.so into the project's root directory 
  (not src!)
- Follow the above instructions for building on Windows

Building on Mac:

- Install the Xcode command-line tools
- Install SDL2 from Homebrew: brew install sdl2
- Copy /usr/local/lib/libSDL2.dylib to the project's root directory (Propulse
  will not run otherwise)
- Download BASS for macOS from https://www.un4seen.com/ and copy libbass.dylib
  into the project's root directory
- Append this line to your /etc/fpc.cfg if you are running 10.14 (Mojave) or
  newer:
      -XR/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk
- Follow the above instructions for building on Windows
